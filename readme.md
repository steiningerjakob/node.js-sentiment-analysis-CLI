# Node.js Sentiment Analysis CLI

This command line app will use the demo API on apidemo.theysay.io to analyze text that unsers pass in on the command line (either as an additional argument or reading from a file) and print out the "mood" of the text, including:

- whether it is positive, negative or neutral
- what percentage of each the text is
- what kind of confidence rating it has
